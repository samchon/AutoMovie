import type { ITtscLintConfig } from "@ttsc/lint";

/**
 * `@ttsc/lint` config for this automovie project — applied automatically by
 * `ttsc` (`npm run lint` runs `ttsc --noEmit`) and autofixed by `npm run
 * format` (`ttsc format`). The engine is the arbiter of physical truth at
 * runtime; this config is the arbiter of code health at build time.
 *
 * The `format` block mirrors automovie's own house style (80 columns, double
 * quotes, semicolons, `lf`, trailing commas, third-party-then-relative import
 * order); its `severity: "off"` means formatting is a `npm run format` opt-in,
 * not a build blocker. The `rules` are a deliberately small, high-value
 * CORRECTNESS set — the classes of bug this stack is most exposed to — not a
 * style dragnet:
 *
 * - `switch-exhaustiveness-check` is the load-bearing one: automovie's API is
 *   discriminated unions everywhere (action verbs, shapes, targets), and an
 *   unhandled variant is exactly the silent-skip the engine's own doctrine
 *   forbids — here the compiler catches it in YOUR code too.
 * - `no-floating-promises` / `no-misused-promises` / `await-thenable` guard the
 *   async render and perform paths from dropped promises.
 * - `no-explicit-any` keeps you inside the typed contract the engine enforces
 *   against — an `any` is where a malformed pose slips past the type layer.
 * - The rest (`eqeqeq`, `no-var`, `prefer-const`, `no-self-compare`,
 *   `no-fallthrough`, `no-duplicate-imports`, `ban-ts-comment`, the small
 *   autofixable TypeScript rules) are cheap, unambiguous, and mechanically
 *   fixable.
 *
 * Add to it as your project grows; every rule here is `error` because each one
 * flags a real defect, not a preference.
