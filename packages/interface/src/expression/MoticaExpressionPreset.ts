/**
 * The closed set of **VRM 1.0 expression presets** — high-level named emotions
 * and visemes.
 *
 * Where {@link "./MoticaArkitChannel"} is the fine-grained 52-channel control,
 * presets are the _coarse, semantic_ control surface: a single name an LLM can
 * pick to convey an emotion or a mouth shape, which the runtime expands into
 * the underlying blendshapes. Presets retarget across every VRM avatar
 * generically (the avatar author defines how each preset deforms its own mesh),
 * making them the most portable and most LLM-reliable expression handle.
 *
 * The five `aa`/`ih`/`ou`/`ee`/`oh` visemes drive lip-sync; the emotion set
 * drives mood; `blink` and the look directions drive eyes.
 *
 * Reference: VRM 1.0 expressions (https://vrm.dev/en/vrm/vrm_features/).
