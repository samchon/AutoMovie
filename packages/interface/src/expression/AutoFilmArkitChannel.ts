/**
 * The closed set of **ARKit 52 facial blendshape** channels.
 *
 * ARKit's 52 coefficients are the de-facto industry standard for facial
 * expression: Apple face tracking, MetaHuman, Ready Player Me, and NVIDIA
 * Audio2Face all target them, each in `[0, 1]`. For autofilm this is the ideal
 * structured-output target — a fixed, named, normalized, _low_-dimensional
 * vector. The model picks channels from this closed menu (so an invalid channel
 * name is impossible) and assigns weights documented to `[0, 1]` (the engine
 * clamps/validates the magnitude).
 *
 * Naming follows Apple's `ARFaceAnchor.BlendShapeLocation` lowerCamelCase keys
 * verbatim, so a autofilm expression maps 1:1 onto any ARKit-compatible
 * runtime.
 *
 * Reference: Apple ARKit `ARFaceAnchor.blendShapes`
 * (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor/blendshapes).
