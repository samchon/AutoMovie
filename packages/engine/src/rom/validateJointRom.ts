/**
 * Validate one joint's articulation against its anatomical range of motion,
 * pushing a `rom` violation per offending axis.
 *
 * Two failure modes per axis:
 *
 * - The joint specifies a non-zero angle on an axis the constraint marks `null`
 *   (the joint physically does not move that way — e.g. an elbow abducting);
 * - The angle is outside the allowed `[min, max]`.
 *
 * `path` is the JSON path of the joint (e.g. `$input.joints[3]`); the offending
 * axis is appended so the `// ❌` feedback points at the exact field.
