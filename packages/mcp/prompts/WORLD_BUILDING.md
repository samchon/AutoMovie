# World Building Handbook

A world is a system of meaningful places, routes, constraints, and environmental cues. Decorative density is not world design. Begin with the actions and spatial decisions the screenplay requires, then build enough terrain and landmarks to make those decisions readable.

## Semantic layout

List stable anchors before generating detail:

- entrances, exits, objectives, threats, refuges, observation points, and horizon features;
- routes with width, slope, surface, direction, and traversal class;
- regions with narrative function, material, vegetation, occupancy, and visibility;
- ground contacts and height references for every staged subject;
- light, weather, atmosphere, and effect bounds.

Give each anchor a stable id. Shot contracts and acceptance scenarios refer to meaning, not guessed coordinates. Coordinates remain deterministic engine facts derived from the authored world record.

## Scale and traversal

Choose world units from the production contract and verify human, vehicle, building, terrain, and formation scale together. A road wide enough in a map may fail when a formation, turning radius, camera, and occlusion are considered. Test travel distance, slope, clearance, reach, line of sight, and camera distance with engine queries outside the compile sandbox.

Preserve walkable or traversable continuity. Place barriers where they communicate or constrain action, not where procedural noise happens to put them. Mark dangerous or forbidden regions explicitly. Do not rely on render detail to enforce a physical rule the engine does not know.

## Procedural generation

Use deterministic seeds and bounded algorithms. Generate from semantic anchors outward:

1. lock story-critical anchors and routes;
2. derive large terrain forms and visibility corridors;
3. allocate secondary regions;
4. scatter repeated detail with exclusion zones and density limits;
5. add authored hero exceptions;
6. verify bounds, contacts, overlaps, and required sightlines.

OpenUSD composition is a useful mental model for complex external worlds: references and payloads let assets compose without destructive copying, while variant sets preserve explicit alternatives. Regardless of format, register exact source, license, digest, conversion, and chosen variant in AutoMovie ownership.

## Environmental storytelling

Let the world show prior action, use, culture, logistics, weather, and conflict through wear, orientation, debris, routes, defenses, vegetation, sound, and light. Repetition establishes a system; one deliberate exception directs attention. Keep hero landmarks distinct in silhouette and value so they remain useful to both characters and camera.

## Atmosphere and effects

Fog, smoke, dust, rain, fire, and crowds need spatial and temporal bounds. They may reveal scale, hide transitions, carry wind, or change visibility, but they must not erase required subjects or acceptance evidence. Treat effects as authored systems with source, lifetime, region, density, and delivery cost.

## Verification

Inspect plan, eye-level, action-level, and camera views. Check ground contact, route continuity, landmark visibility, formation fit, camera clearance, scale, horizon, repetition artifacts, and whether the environment changes story interpretation. World beauty is subordinate to readable action and durable semantic joins.
